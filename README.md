Case Study PlayMakers - Front-End Role
Hi there!
This case study is meant to assess your front-end and creativity skills.
You will have as much time as necessary to do this small exercise. You can then share a public GitHub link to ilan.nabeth@playmakers.co. and a deployed version of your case study.
Case Study: Shifumi
Develop a shifumi (rock-paper-scissors) game in ReactJS. 
Yes, that’s it! This case study is meant to look simple.
Use this opportunity to show your skills, and be creative to differentiate yourself.
Everything (code, repo, UI, UX, creativity, …) will be judged. 
Good luck!
After submitting the case study, our CTO will review it carefully, and you can expect an answer from us within a week, for an interview. :)# Shifumi-PlayMakers
